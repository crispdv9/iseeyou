            <h1>About </h1>
            <h2>/The project </h2>
            <p>I SEE YOU is a project developed during the Final Sintesis Laboratory in <i><b>Density Lab</i></b> at the <i><b>Politecnico di Milano</i></b>.</p>
            <p>This project is an extension of <a href="https://densitydesign.github.io/teaching-dd15/course-results/es02/group02/">protocol 3 from phase II</a>, which highlighted- what’s being captured by the most recent cameras on a website called Insecam. During that phase we collected different videos in different countries to show the variety between them and the relevance of the content.</p>
            <p>I SEE YOU, showcases six different stories of leaked security camera footage found on Insecam, each from a different country. These act as starting point for revealing their vulnerability. It takes the audience through an informative and interactive journey of easily tracing the exact location, name and contact details of the owner of the camera. It further provides an opportunity to the audience to contact and inform the owner about their privacy being at risk. In the end the audience can also download a security manual to know basic tips to prevent data breach.</p>

    <div class="col-md-offset- col-md-6">

            <h2 >/Aim, focus and objective </h2>
            <p>The aim of this project is to inform the audience that the security camera feed can be easily tracked through simple online tools in just a few clicks with a simple language and real content.</p>
            <p>The project focuses on the use of security cameras and the possible consequences of a bad use of them. It is also focuses a specific audience, existing owners or potential owners of security cameras and people who are directly or indirectly under security camera vigilance.</p>
            <p>The main objective of the project is to reflect the vulnerability of cameras that is often more pervasive than expected. People use cameras to feel safe, but paradoxically end up putting their privacy and security at risk. With this project we want to inform, warn and provoque creating a direct response in the audience.</p>
            <h2 >/Message </h2>
            <p>Surveillance cameras are becoming part of our daily lives all around the world. People use these cameras freely in every kind of situation. But how would you feel if you knew that someone can watch what you are doing in another country and identify where are you staying? Showing unauthorized access to these videos, the direct message is the vulnerability of these cameras and the ignorance of the possible use of them. How can a security device invert the roles of security and become a window to the personal world?</p><br>

            <h2 >/The process and tools used</h2>
            <p>The entire research and execution process has been carried out manually. We picked 6 videos of different countries and locations for example a bar in Italy, a motorcycle shop in France, a fast-food restaurant in the USA, etc. We created a video for each one to document the process of tracing these cameras. </p>
            <p>First, we observed cameras in different countries analysing them and looking specific details that make us find the location.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p>We used platforms like- Google Search, Google Maps,Trip Advisor, Facebook to search the location of the cameras and obtain supporting evidence to re-check the correct address. Through the exact location or name of the store, it becomes very easy to obtain their contact information online. </p>
            <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
</div>
            <div class="col-md-offset- col-md-6">

            <p>After we obtained data as the phone number, we decided to call them to confirm the camera location and to advise the owners of the open camera. As we choose different countries we called in the local language and we added English subtitles in the video. It is interesting to note the different kind of response and reactions people have to the situation. Some are shocked or frightened whereas some think this is a prank and hang up the call. These reactions resonates with the fact that the people are unaware of this situation and therefore it requires urgent attention.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p>During some steps of the videos, the user is asked if want to continue to watch the video or prefer to maintain people’s privacy.  </p>
            <p>Sassari, SS, Italy <br>
              Billy-Montigny, HDF, France<br>
              Erechim, RS, Brazil<br>
              Buenos Aires, BA, Argentina<br>
              Gastonia, NC, USA<br>
              Oviedo, AST, Spain<br></p>
            <p>Unless we have the entire conversation, we didn’t want to distribute the whole to protect the anonymity of the person. We explained at the end of the video the main reactions during the phone call.</p><br>

            <h2 >/Visual Language </h2>
              <p>The digital language is reused in a very simple, real and raw manner that helps the audience to actually experience a real life situation. For example, exact shots are taken from websites like Google Maps and Trip Advisor. </p>
              <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
              <p>It provokes a feeling of taking proactive measures to prevent unauthorized access of security cameras. Sound effects are an important part of the project. It makes it interesting and provides a real feel to the audience. The combination of data, visual, text and interaction helps the audience to be more conscious about privacy concerns and acts as torchbearers to spread awareness.</p><br>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-offset- col-md-6">

            <h2 >/Data Source</h2>
            <p>  <br><a href="https://www.insecam.org/">Insecam</a>,  is an online directory of surveillance security cameras. It displays unsecured cameras  from all around the world categorized by location, country, city, popularity or tags. These cameras are either streaming on publicly accessible network ports or are still using the default passwords, thereby allowing anyone to gain access to the stream. One can easily see the live feed of these open cameras and also see the brand of camera, latitude and longitude (IP address of security camera).</p>
              <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
              <p>The material shown in the project has been collected and edited directly for us. It’s possible to access to part of this content here. The data regarding the website is available here.</p><br>

            <h2 >/Interactions </h2>
            <p>In the main page, it’s possible to choose between the six different videos and decide with which story to begin. Moreover, when the video is finished, it’s possible to go back and watch the other videos. </p>
            <p>At various steps the audience is given the possibility to either keep going deeper in the data breach or to opt out. The idea is to actively involve and engage the audience while transmitting the idea of doing something “not allowed”. Giving the option to not continue also tries to give the user the possibility to continue or respects other’s privacy.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <p>Moreover, after the call, there is a screen showing the possibility to call to the owner of the camera. That makes feel the audience that is going to be able to contact that person, creating more engaging and preparation for the last part of the video. </p>
            <p>A predefined script is presented to make sure that the audience convey the precise message to the security camera owner. It prepares them to spread awareness regarding security cameras vulnerability. By doing this the message is reached and absorbed by both the audience and the camera owner. At the end, the phone call is not possible to do and the last video appears.</p>
            <img class="pictures" src="images/oviedo.gif" style="width:200px;height:100px;">
            <br>

            <div class="col-md-offset- col-md-6">

            <h2 >/Security manual</h2>
            <p>In order to further help the audience to avoid this privacy access in cameras, we developed a list of security advises to protect the devices and prevent this situations. For example, putting a strong password or to not use the default password. These prevention measures if adopted can reduce the risk of data breach and personal security.</p>

            <p><b>Privacy note-</b> Privacy note: During the process there are some details we decided to hide to respect people's privacy. For example, pixelating/blurring the face of camera owners and their contact details</p>
